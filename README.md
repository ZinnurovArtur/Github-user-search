# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app solution

This is a solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). Frontend Mentor challenges helped me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
